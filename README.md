# Trade Tariff Management

## Development

### Dependencies

  - Ruby
  - Postgresql
  - Redis (must be running for search)
  - Chrome (for integration specs)

### Setup

1. Setup your environment.

    bin/setup

2. Update `.env` file with valid data (or copy .env.test)

3. Start Foreman.

    foreman start

4. Verify that the app is up and running.

    open http://localhost:3020/healthcheck

## Test

1. RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:structure:load

2. RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec spec/

### CI

CI for this project is provided by CircleCI: https://circleci.com/gh/uktrade/trade-tariff-management.


## Deployment

We deploy using the DIT CI Deployment pipeline to manage deployments:
https://github.com/uktrade/ci-pipeline-config
The Procfile specifies what will run on the PaaS https://github.com/uktrade/trade-tariff-management/blob/master/Procfile

NB: In the newer Diego architecture from CloudFoundry, no-route skips creating and binding a route for the app, but does not specify which type of health check to perform. If your app does not listen on a port, for example the sidekiq worker, then it does not satisfy the port-based health check and Cloud Foundry marks it as crashed. To prevent this, disable the port-based health check with cf set-health-check APP_NAME none.

## Notes

* When writing validators in `app/validators` please run the rake task
`audit:verify` which runs the validator against existing data.

### Environment variables

- `XML_ENVELOPE_ID_OFFSET_YEAR_<YYYY>` - allows the XML envelope ID to be
  started from a value other than one. This intended to allow the sequence to
  follow-on from the ID reached by other system before cut-over.
